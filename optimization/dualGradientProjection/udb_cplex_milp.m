%UDB_CPLEX_MILP Solve a MILP to find the upper dual bound
%
% This function will solve a MILP given in [1] to find an upper bound on
% the size of the 1-norm for the dual variable vector. Note that this
% function operates on a infinity-norm bounded set for p.
%
% The MILP solved is:
%   max     sum(y)
%   s.t.  D0*p <= Cd0
%         del(i) = 0 ==> y(i) = 0
%         del(i) = 1 ==> Hd(i,:)*y + Jd(i,:)*p = -g(i)
%
% This function requires that CPLEX is installed, since it is used to
% solve the optimization problem.

%
% Usage:
%   [ Delta ] = UDB_CPLEX_MILP( Hd, Jd, g, L, plb, pub, N, pCon );

%   Jd   - The dual linear matrix multiplying the initial state
%   g    - The vector from the RHS of the primal constraints
%   L    - The largest eigenvalue of the Hessian matrix
%   D0   - LHS for the polyhedral constraint on the initial state
%   Cd0  - RHS for the polyhedral constraint on the initial state
%   N    - The horizon length
%   pcon - 
%
% Optional name/vaue pairs:
%   'Ticks' - The number of ticks to run the optimizer for
%   'Time' - The number of seconds to run the optimizer for
%   'Tolerance' - The relative optimality tolerance to solve to
%                 (between 0 and 1, representing percentages)
%
% Output:
%   Delta - The upper dual bound
%   rel   - The relative gap between the bound and optimality
